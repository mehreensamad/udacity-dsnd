## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. What is the average salary for each programming language? And which programming language, on average, is most rewarding?
2. What is the average job satisfaction for each programming language? And which programming language, on average, gives the most job satisfaction?
3. Which programming languages were the most popular for the top 5 countries (defined by number of entries in the survery) for languages worked with and languages wanted to work with?

## File Description
There is 1 notebook available here (Stack_Overflow_Survey_Analysis.ipynb) to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available Use <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">**here**</a>.

## Acknowledgements
